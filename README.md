#### Project Goals

The primary goal of this website is to sere as a personal portfolio website for my own game development work. The website will serve as a showcase of my work with detail about my work style and philosophies as a tool to show potential employers or collaborators within the industry. There are two target audiences: my peers within the industry, and potential employers.
