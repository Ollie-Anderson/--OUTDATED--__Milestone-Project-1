#### Milestone Project One - User Centric Static Front End

------

This website is designed to act as a game development portfolio to help me grow an audience and find work/projects. It serves to showcase my work and skills as a developer,  allow users to contact me regarding projects, and allow potential employers to asses and contact me regarding employment opportunities.

This website has been created as the first milestone project for Code Institute's  Diploma in Web Application Development. In line with their criteria, my contributions to this site are comprised only of HTML and CSS, with any other functionality (e.g. page scripts) coming from third party libraries. All external code is referenced appropriately.

# User Experience

## User Stories

#### Game Development Studios looking to hire new staff

As a Studio Owner or Hiring manager I need to see a showcase of the potential employee's skill to determine if they are skilled enough to work for my studio. For this, I will need to see examples of their work as proof of skill, as well as know their interests within the field.

I need to know what software and frameworks/languages they are familiar with to ensure they can work with the tools we use as a studio.

I also need to know about the person as an individual with context to the games industry. What games they like to play, what games they like to make, and their drive as an individual within the field. This will allow me to determine if they will fit well  within the team, and if they are the right candidate for _our_ studio and _our_ work.

##### Website Requirements: 

* showcase of work
* personal profile

The work history page will feature an additional vertical timeline navigation bar on the left side of the page to allow the user to quickly and easily navigate through various projects/employers.





Bugs
======

Bugs are created in '[Unresolved](#Unresolved)' as they appear and transferred to '[Resolved](#Resolved])' if and when they are fixed. all bug logs are formatted as follows: 

{Date of Discovery} ###### **Bug Title** ###### {Date of Resolution (if applicable)}

## Resolved

* {24/05/22} ###### **Z-Index Display Issue on Homepage Slideshow** ###### {28/05/22}
  * attempted slideshow on homepage section previews were displaying on top of sticky header and footer elements, obscuring the content of said elements.
  * easy fix with z-index on header but I would like to find the cause of the issue if possible.
  * couldn't find the cause, fixed by giving both the slideshow, and header and footer elements hierarchal z-index values
  * The slideshow element that was causing the issue was eventually removed due to scroll margin issues and redesign of the sections.

* {24/05/22} ###### **Scroll Margin Issue With Slideshow Functionality** ######{02/06/22}
  * the slides on the homepage sections are created in pure CSS (no externally sourced JavaScript) using ID links to scroll horizontally within the section. However, the scroll-margin-top property is not affecting the way they scroll, causing the page to scroll behind the header when the arrows are clicked.
  * Feature removed. I couldn't fix the issue

* {12/06/22} ###### **Overlapping Text on Homepage Section Descriptions** ###### {12/06/22}
  * when testing and designing my site for device responsiveness, I end up with overflowing text at certain points. By design I can find no easy solution to the issues without creating a large number of media queries and potential height based media queries for the more unusually sized devices. 
  * This issue was first discovered when transferring from my desktop PC to my surface 2 in 1. The unusual tablet ratio caused certain media queries to trigger but the text was not displaying in a clean way.
  * fixed by creating automatic y-overflow behaviour allowing me to keep readable font sizes without sacrificing content. 
  * Not sure how I feel about sub scrolling sections on my homepage but it's more elegant than having either wasted space or missing text.


## Unresolved

* {24/05/22} ###### **Header min width altered by child element margins** ######
  * with the current styling there's an additional 60px determining the minimum display width in the browser (found using developer tools). attempts to alter this with box-sizing: margin-box has caused more issues with styling so I have elected to leave this and design the site around it for ease. 
  * the site is still responsively functional, I just need to bare this in mind when

## Outside Code

### Responsive Top menu Navbar

I have borrowed code from w3schools.com that features some basic JavaScript to make the top menu navigation bar responsive. I've used this code as I've not used the bootstrap library for the base of my code.



## 3rd Party Site Embedding

### Sketchfab

Where relevant I have embedded Sketchfab content to provide interactive views of 3D models. This was done by following the embedding tutorial on the Sketchfab website. [Code Source](https://sketchfab.com/blogs/enterprise/news/getting-started-with-sketchfab)

All interactive 3D model viewports on my site are live links to my own models on sketchfab, using their embedding method. I have modified their code where appropriate to keep consistent styling.
