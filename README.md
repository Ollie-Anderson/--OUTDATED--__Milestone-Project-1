#### Milestone Project One - User Centric Static Front End

------

This website is designed to act as a game development portfolio to help me grow an audience and find work/projects. It serves to showcase my work and skills as a developer,  allow users to contact me regarding projects, and serve as a blog of what I'm currently working on.

This website has been created as the first milestone project for Code Institute's  Diploma in Web Application Development. In line with their criteria, my contributions to this site are comprised only of HTML and CSS, with any other functionality (e.g. page scripts) coming from third party libraries. All external code is referenced appropriately.
