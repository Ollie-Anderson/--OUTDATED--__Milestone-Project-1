							<h3>Programmer</h3>
							<div>
								<p>As a programmer, most of my work is in Unreal Engine&#174;'s Blueprint system. My strengths lie in creating player driven gameplay such as ability systems, stealth, movement, and systemic gameplay. I also have experience in AI scripting.
								I prefer designing interaction based events, rather than hard coding, to create diverse and evolving gameplay.</p>
								
								<p>I have a deep knowledge of the blueprint system, with a diverse range of projects to my name, backed up by an intuitive understanding of programming paradigms and pure languages like c++, c#, and python. I am also a quick and resourceful learner, allowing me to easily adapt to any studio's pipeline with ease.</p>
								
								<p class="screenSize-md-none">My skills are built on a versed understanding of User Experience, Psychology, and Game Theory, helping me to create truly engaging player experiences.</p>

							<h3>Artist</h3>
							<div>
								<p>As an artist my primary focus is 3D hard surface modelling using tools such as Blender and Autodesk Maya. I am familiar with the design process start to finish, concept to game ready including texturing, LODs, bump/normal mapping, and some basic skills with sculpting.</p>
								
								<p>My biggest strengths as an artist are in prop and environment design, as well as technical roles where my programming knowledge compliments my artistic skills. I prefer working on stlyized projects rather than photorealistic but can easily adapt in this regard. I am also reasonably skilled in rigging for animation.</p>
								
								<p class="screenSize-md-none">My focus as a game artist is primarily in 3D modelling and design. Though I have a good understanding of core artistic principles, affording me transferrable skills and flexility within a team.</p>

							<h3>Designer</h3>
							<div>
								<p>When it comes to my design philosophy, my to focus on creating divergent, player driven experiences through systemic game design. I believe that even in narrative-focused games it's important to also tell a story through the gameplay.</p>
								
								<p>The deepest binds form between player and game when their exrience is wholly unque, even when experienceing the same things as others. Designing gameplay that allows players to decide their approach crates long lasting memories, and stronger feelings of influnce and control.</p>
								
								<p class="screenSize-md-none">Overall, I think the most important aspect of design is cohesiveness. Everything from mechanics, to set pieces, to audio, UI, and even the level geometry should complement eachother to make a truly impactful moment.</p>
